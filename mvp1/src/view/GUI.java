/**
 * GUI - Graphical User Interface
 * 
 * The GUI is actually the face of our project.
 * 
 * the GUI a type of user interface that contains a graphical icons,labels,buttons ... etc ... 
 * the user is actually using the GUI to use our program. (in our case is a 3d maze game).
 * the GUI is the best interface from any other interface because 
 * its a very comfortable and intuitive way to show the user our project.
 * 
 * the user don't see our code, he just see the result - the graphical components.
